AI is also a branch of computer science that embodies machine learning and\\nits sub-domains like deep learning. AI has of recent been the reason most businesses\\nhave been making a lot of income.\\n1.2 Explain the difference between machine learning and\\ndeep learning\\nFirstly, machine learning is a broader field than deep learning and deep learning is a\\nbranch of machine learning while machine learning itself is a branch of AI. Machine\\nlearning is therefore a branch of AI that involves the use of statistical models in making\\npredictions and forecasts by either exposing the models to labelled data or unlabelled\\ndata.\\nOn the other hand, deep learning is a branch of machine learning that uses a large\\nnumber of layers containing neurons to learn patters in complex data in order to make\\naccurate predictions.\\nDeep learning is majorly subdivided into artificial neural networks(ANN), recurrent'),\n",

RNN is a type of\\ndeep learning model that is used for textual or sequential data. CNN is a type of deep\\nlearning model that is used for image classification, object detection\\n1.3 Describe each type of machine learning\\n1. Supervised Learning Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which\\nmachine learning models are trained on labeled data, i.e., data whose target or\\ndependent variable is present alongside the independent variables. Examples of\\nsuch models are: Logistic regression, random forest , linear regression models,\\nsvm\\n2. Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data, where the goal is to find\\npatterns or structures within the data. This is often used in clustering and dimen-\\nsionality reduction. A real-world example is customer segmentation in marketing,\\nwhere users are grouped based on their behavior or preferences without prede-\\nfined categories.\\n3. Reinforcement Learning focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions\\nby interacting with an environment. The agent learns by receiving rewards or\\npenalties for its actions. A practical example is training autonomous vehicles to\\nnavigate roads safely, optimizing for efficiency and avoiding collisions.\\n1.4 Give an example of where Deep Learning might be\\nmore effective than traditional Machine Learning\\nDeep Learning can be more effective than traditional Machine Learning when dealing\\nwith high-dimensional and unstructured data, such as images, audio, or text. For\\ninstance, in facial recognition tasks, deep learning models like Convolutional Neural\\nNetworks (CNNs) outperform traditional methods by automatically extracting hierar-\\nchical features from images, which would be challenging and less effective with manual'),\n",

Discriminative models : Discriminative models focus on learning the decision\\nboundary between classes by directly modeling the conditional probability\\nP(y/x) (1.1)\\nwhere y represents the label and x represents the input data. These models are\\nprimarily used for classification or regression tasks. Examples include Logistic\\nRegression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).\\n2. Generative Models: Generative models, on the other hand, aim to model the joint\\nprobability distribution\\nP(x, y) (1.2)\\nor the distribution of the input data\\nP(x) (1.3)\\nThey learn how the data is generated, which allows them to create new data\\nsamples similar to the training data. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models\\n(GMM), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and Generative Adversarial Networks\\n(GANs).'),\n",

It works by analyzing input data and predicting the likelihood of an outcome\\nbelonging to a particular class. The model uses a function that compresses outputs into\\nprobabilities between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks. Based\\non these probabilities, it assigns the data to one of the two categories by applying a\\nthreshold, usually 0.5.\\nA practical example is email spam detection. Logistic Regression can classify emails\\nas \"spam\" or \"not spam\" by examining features such as word usage, sender details, and\\nmessage formatting. Its simplicity and effectiveness with structured data make it ideal\\nfor such binary classification problems.'),\n",

It has four features:\\nsepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\\n2. Task Explanation This dataset is well-suited for supervised learning because it\\ncontains labeled data, where each flower sample is associated with its correspond-\\ning species.
